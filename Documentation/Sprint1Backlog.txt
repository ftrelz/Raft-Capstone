- - Fix any concurrency issues with reading and writing logs
  - May need to add some semaphores to the task above
  - Jessie
- Implement 5 logs for testing all hosts (this won't matter
  for raspberry pi's)
  - Fred
- Proper HAndling of AppendEntries Messages (Log Entries)
  - Jessie
- Implement Leader commit Logic
  - Fred
- Implement logs to hold messages
  - Jessie and Fred
- May need to use a dictionary to store all logs
  - The reason for this is because it might be beneficial to
    have to have a certified index in the message that would
    indicate that it is the key for that Log Entry. Order
    won't matter then.
    Ex: [0:Log1, 4:Log5, 2:Log3]
