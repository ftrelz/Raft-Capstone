---- Created 1/17/2017 ----

Things that need to be done for completion of tasks:
 - We need a daily report (atleast 3 times a week on progress)
   - The method that I am thinking about is doing an email stand up 
     where we can state two things: What we have done up to last
     standup report to the current stand up report and what we plan
     to have accomplished for the next standup report. This will take
     place around 10am - 11am on Monday, Wednesday and Friday everyweek.
   - A copy of each members standup should be forwarded to Dr.Esposito
     so he knows of the current progress of the project.
 - We need two days that we can meet up atleast to work on the project
   together and talk about design decisions. The time that these meetings
   will take should be atleast 2 to 3 hours long. One of these days will
   be on the weekend while another one should be a weekday.
 - A backlog should be made to indicate what needs to be done. New items
   should be added to the backlog once every 2 weeks. Every item in the
   backlog should be associated with a number of difficulty. Ranging from
   1 to 20 as scrum poker has I believe.
 - Weekly goals should be made in place to have a realization on what
   needs to be done.

We need to figure out the days in which we want to meet:
 - I can't meet on Mondays and Fridays
 - I believe Saturday and Wednesday works good for me.
 - Should we change meetings with Fabio on Tuesdays?
