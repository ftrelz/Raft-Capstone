--- Backlog Created 1/18/17 ---
--- Backlog Contains Tasks to Complete by 1/30 ---

Important Note:
 - For each task, proper testing and documentation should
   be enacted to insure completion and understanding for each
   functionality of the project.

Syntax of Creating Tasks:
- Task_Name            Ranking_of_Task
  - Assigned_Person_to_Complete_Task 

Tasks:                                                        Rank:  
- Fix any concurrency issues with reading and writing logs
  - May need to add some semaphores to the task above
  - Jessie
- Implement 5 logs for testing all hosts (this won't matter 
  for raspberry pi's)
  - Fred
- Proper HAndling of AppendEntries Messages (Log Entries)
  - Jessie

- Make a script to start all connections in the raspberry pi's 
- Implement Leader commit Logic
  - Fred   
- Fix when return False in transitions    
- Implement logs to hold messages
  - Jessie and Fred
- Set up concurrency of threads correctly
- Complete system testing
- May need to use a dictionary to store all logs
  - The reason for this is because it might be beneficial to
    have to have a certified index in the message that would
    indicate that it is the key for that Log Entry. Order 
    won't matter then.
    Ex: [0:Log1, 4:Log5, 2:Log3]
